<p>Last night as I celebrated the beginning of a new year with friends and family we reflected on Proverbs 3:5-6:</p>

<p>Many of you know that I have been working for three hours a day, during the lunch rush, at the cafe in the Yellow Grass skating rink. On Monday the lady who runs the cafe (Donna) is heading out of town for four days to take a well deserved break. I offered to cover for her, so that means four days of getting up at 5AM to make coffee and cook eggs and toast for the people of Yellow Grass. Many of the people who come in to the cafe in the morning do not come for lunch, so this is an opportunity for me to connect with more people. Business at the cafe has been fairly slow during the winter months, but this last week things really started to pick up again, so I would greatly appreciate your prayers during the next few days. I do have someone coming in to help during the lunch hour, which is usually the busiest time of the day, but neither of us has the skill and experience of Donna. You could also pray that I will be able to connect with the people who come in to eat, and that I will be able to explain my purpose in coming to Yellow Grass.</p>

<li><h2><a href="/text/first-gathering-complete/">First Gathering: Complete</a></h2> - December 5, 2011
<p>We had our first fellowship gathering yesterday. Besides myself, 21 people came out. The service included singing, a short devotional, communion, a prayer time, and fellowship over coffee and rice krispie squares afterwards. Praise God that it was a success! Thank you all for your continued prayers.</p>

<li><h2><a href="/text/december-4/">December 4</a></h2> - November 28, 2011
<p>I’ve been meaning to post this for a while now… December 4 (this Sunday already!) is the launch date for our Sunday evening gathering. We hope that this will be a place for worship, discipleship, and fellowship which will bring Christians together to make a positive impact in the community. Prayers are appreciated!</p>

<li><h2><a href="/text/success/">Success!</a></h2> - October 20, 2011
<p>Our first kid’s program is complete and was a success. We had a dozen kids out, which was good because we ran into a few problems letting people know that we were starting today. Now that the word is out and the kids will be telling their friends, we are optimistic that we will have a larger group next week. Thanks to everyone who was praying today!</p>
