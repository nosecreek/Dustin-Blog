<li><h2><a href="/text/first-gathering-complete/">First Gathering: Complete</a></h2> - December 5, 2011
<p>We had our first fellowship gathering yesterday. Besides myself, 21 people came out. The service included singing, a short devotional, communion, a prayer time, and fellowship over coffee and rice krispie squares afterwards. Praise God that it was a success! Thank you all for your continued prayers.</p>

<li><h2><a href="/text/december-4/">December 4</a></h2> - November 28, 2011
<p>I’ve been meaning to post this for a while now… December 4 (this Sunday already!) is the launch date for our Sunday evening gathering. We hope that this will be a place for worship, discipleship, and fellowship which will bring Christians together to make a positive impact in the community. Prayers are appreciated!</p>
