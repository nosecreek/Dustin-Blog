<li><h2><a href="/hikes/stanley-glacier/">Stanley Glacier</a></h2> - September 27, 2018
<p>Some hikes are all about the beautiful view at the destination, but with Stanley Glacier you enjoy beautiful and changing scenery for the duration of the hike. You will climb towards the toe of Stanley Glacier as you travel alongside a waterfall and the burned but beautiful remnants of a forest fire.</p>

<li><h2><a href="/hikes/ink-pots-johnston-canyon/">Ink Pots & Johnston Canyon</a></h2> - September 5, 2018
<p>Johnston canyon is extermely popular. This isn't without reason as the canyon is beautiful. But if you keep hiking beyond the upper falls you will eventually reach the Ink Pots which are the real jewel of this hike. The portion of the trail after the upper falls is the most intense, with significantly more elevation gain. But you will also be glad to be away from the crowds for a while. After a long, steady incline you'll eventually head back down hill and reach the Ink Pots, which are spring fed pools of water with brilliant color in the midst of a mountain meadow. Be sure to heed the signs and don't disturb the pools. Pack a lunch and take some time to picnic while you enjoy the natural beauty of your destination.</p>

<li><h2><a href="/photos/a-crazy-summer/">A Crazy Summer</a></h2> - July 20, 2014
<p>I think its safe to that my summer is off to a crazy, but amazing, start. On June 27 I left for Estonia with 10 wonderful people (7 high school students and 3 leaders) to lead a three-week mission trip. We arrived early Sunday morning (just after midnight) and caught a few hours of sleep before heading to church and then camp. Camp ran Sunday-Friday and our team’s responsibilites included being cabin counselors and teaching a lesson on Thursday morning. This was an intereseting experience as the campers ranged in age from 8 up to over 18. Everything also had to be translated – twice – as most campers spoke either Russian or Estonian. We relied primarily on a mostly silent skit and an object lesson to make our point about being strong and courageous as we follow God’s law (<a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/joshua/passage.aspx?q=joshua%201:7-8">Joshua 1:7-8</a>). Throughout the week it was incredible to watch the way our team connected with the locals and excelled at all of their responsibilites, despite the fact that many of them had either very little camp experience or none at all.</p>
