<li><h2><a href="/text/success/">Success!</a></h2> - October 20, 2011
<p>Our first kid’s program is complete and was a success. We had a dozen kids out, which was good because we ran into a few problems letting people know that we were starting today. Now that the word is out and the kids will be telling their friends, we are optimistic that we will have a larger group next week. Thanks to everyone who was praying today!</p>

<li><h2><a href="/text/a-vision-for-yellow-grass/">A Vision For Yellow Grass</a></h2> - August 17, 2011
<p>Two summers ago I had the privilege of visiting the town of Yellow Grass as part of Alberta Bible College’s Youth Alive in Christ program. Along with three other students and a few mission minded  volunteers from the local community, we ran a successful week-long VBS with a healthy number of children attending. This past fall I was heart broken to hear that there is currently no church presence in Yellow Grass that is actively focusing on reaching the healthy harvest of young families living there. “The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field” (Matthew 9:37-38). At the same time, God was putting similar convictions in the hearts and minds of several others and so began the journey of re-imagining the Kingdom work in Yellow Grass, Saskatchewan.</p>
