<li><h2><a href="/videos/science-fun/">Science Fun</a></h2> - November 8, 2011
<p>Our kid’s program is now meeting on Mondays, due to a conflict with skating practice at the local rink on Thursdays. Our lessons are based on the miracles of Jesus, and also incorporate science. This video is of the experiment we did today. I had an extra egg so I recorded this when I got home.</p>

<li><h2><a href="/text/success/">Success!</a></h2> - October 20, 2011
<p>Our first kid’s program is complete and was a success. We had a dozen kids out, which was good because we ran into a few problems letting people know that we were starting today. Now that the word is out and the kids will be telling their friends, we are optimistic that we will have a larger group next week. Thanks to everyone who was praying today!</p>
