<li><h2><a href="/text/dustin-the-chef/">Dustin the Chef?</a></h2> - February 4, 2012
<p>Many of you know that I have been working for three hours a day, during the lunch rush, at the cafe in the Yellow Grass skating rink. On Monday the lady who runs the cafe (Donna) is heading out of town for four days to take a well deserved break. I offered to cover for her, so that means four days of getting up at 5AM to make coffee and cook eggs and toast for the people of Yellow Grass. Many of the people who come in to the cafe in the morning do not come for lunch, so this is an opportunity for me to connect with more people. Business at the cafe has been fairly slow during the winter months, but this last week things really started to pick up again, so I would greatly appreciate your prayers during the next few days. I do have someone coming in to help during the lunch hour, which is usually the busiest time of the day, but neither of us has the skill and experience of Donna. You could also pray that I will be able to connect with the people who come in to eat, and that I will be able to explain my purpose in coming to Yellow Grass.</p>

<li><h2><a href="/text/first-gathering-complete/">First Gathering: Complete</a></h2> - December 5, 2011
<p>We had our first fellowship gathering yesterday. Besides myself, 21 people came out. The service included singing, a short devotional, communion, a prayer time, and fellowship over coffee and rice krispie squares afterwards. Praise God that it was a success! Thank you all for your continued prayers.</p>

<li><h2><a href="/text/december-4/">December 4</a></h2> - November 28, 2011
<p>I’ve been meaning to post this for a while now… December 4 (this Sunday already!) is the launch date for our Sunday evening gathering. We hope that this will be a place for worship, discipleship, and fellowship which will bring Christians together to make a positive impact in the community. Prayers are appreciated!</p>

<li><h2><a href="/photos/remember/">Remember</a></h2> - November 11, 2011
<p>Since today is Remembrance Day, I thought I would post a few pictures of my trip to Belgium where I visited “Flanders Fields”. Ypress, Belgium was the site of the famous battle of Passchendaele.</p>

<li><h2><a href="/videos/science-fun/">Science Fun</a></h2> - November 8, 2011
<p>Our kid’s program is now meeting on Mondays, due to a conflict with skating practice at the local rink on Thursdays. Our lessons are based on the miracles of Jesus, and also incorporate science. This video is of the experiment we did today. I had an extra egg so I recorded this when I got home.</p>
