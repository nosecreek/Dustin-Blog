<li><h2><a href="/videos/science-fun/">Science Fun</a></h2> - November 8, 2011
<p>Our kid’s program is now meeting on Mondays, due to a conflict with skating practice at the local rink on Thursdays. Our lessons are based on the miracles of Jesus, and also incorporate science. This video is of the experiment we did today. I had an extra egg so I recorded this when I got home.</p>
