<p>Some hikes are all about the beautiful view at the destination, but with Stanley Glacier you enjoy beautiful and changing scenery for the duration of the hike. You will climb towards the toe of Stanley Glacier as you travel alongside a waterfall and the burned but beautiful remnants of a forest fire.</p>

<li><h2><a href="/hikes/ink-pots-johnston-canyon/">Ink Pots & Johnston Canyon</a></h2> - September 5, 2018
<p>Johnston canyon is extermely popular. This isn't without reason as the canyon is beautiful. But if you keep hiking beyond the upper falls you will eventually reach the Ink Pots which are the real jewel of this hike. The portion of the trail after the upper falls is the most intense, with significantly more elevation gain. But you will also be glad to be away from the crowds for a while. After a long, steady incline you'll eventually head back down hill and reach the Ink Pots, which are spring fed pools of water with brilliant color in the midst of a mountain meadow. Be sure to heed the signs and don't disturb the pools. Pack a lunch and take some time to picnic while you enjoy the natural beauty of your destination.</p>

<li><h2><a href="/photos/a-crazy-summer/">A Crazy Summer</a></h2> - July 20, 2014
<p>I think its safe to that my summer is off to a crazy, but amazing, start. On June 27 I left for Estonia with 10 wonderful people (7 high school students and 3 leaders) to lead a three-week mission trip. We arrived early Sunday morning (just after midnight) and caught a few hours of sleep before heading to church and then camp. Camp ran Sunday-Friday and our team’s responsibilites included being cabin counselors and teaching a lesson on Thursday morning. This was an intereseting experience as the campers ranged in age from 8 up to over 18. Everything also had to be translated – twice – as most campers spoke either Russian or Estonian. We relied primarily on a mostly silent skit and an object lesson to make our point about being strong and courageous as we follow God’s law (<a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/joshua/passage.aspx?q=joshua%201:7-8">Joshua 1:7-8</a>). Throughout the week it was incredible to watch the way our team connected with the locals and excelled at all of their responsibilites, despite the fact that many of them had either very little camp experience or none at all.</p>

<li><h2><a href="/text/dustin-the-chef/">Dustin the Chef?</a></h2> - February 4, 2012
<p>Many of you know that I have been working for three hours a day, during the lunch rush, at the cafe in the Yellow Grass skating rink. On Monday the lady who runs the cafe (Donna) is heading out of town for four days to take a well deserved break. I offered to cover for her, so that means four days of getting up at 5AM to make coffee and cook eggs and toast for the people of Yellow Grass. Many of the people who come in to the cafe in the morning do not come for lunch, so this is an opportunity for me to connect with more people. Business at the cafe has been fairly slow during the winter months, but this last week things really started to pick up again, so I would greatly appreciate your prayers during the next few days. I do have someone coming in to help during the lunch hour, which is usually the busiest time of the day, but neither of us has the skill and experience of Donna. You could also pray that I will be able to connect with the people who come in to eat, and that I will be able to explain my purpose in coming to Yellow Grass.</p>

Now that the word is out and the kids will be telling their friends, we are optimistic that we will have a larger group next week. Thanks to everyone who was praying today!</p>

<li><h2><a href="/text/a-vision-for-yellow-grass/">A Vision For Yellow Grass</a></h2> - August 17, 2011
<p>Two summers ago I had the privilege of visiting the town of Yellow Grass as part of Alberta Bible College’s Youth Alive in Christ program. Along with three other students and a few mission minded  volunteers from the local community, we ran a successful week-long VBS with a healthy number of children attending. This past fall I was heart broken to hear that there is currently no church presence in Yellow Grass that is actively focusing on reaching the healthy harvest of young families living there. “The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field” (Matthew 9:37-38). At the same time, God was putting similar convictions in the hearts and minds of several others and so began the journey of re-imagining the Kingdom work in Yellow Grass, Saskatchewan.</p>
