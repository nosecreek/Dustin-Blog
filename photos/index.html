<li><h2><a href="/photos/a-crazy-summer/">A Crazy Summer</a></h2> - July 20, 2014
<p>I think its safe to that my summer is off to a crazy, but amazing, start. On June 27 I left for Estonia with 10 wonderful people (7 high school students and 3 leaders) to lead a three-week mission trip. We arrived early Sunday morning (just after midnight) and caught a few hours of sleep before heading to church and then camp. Camp ran Sunday-Friday and our team’s responsibilites included being cabin counselors and teaching a lesson on Thursday morning. This was an intereseting experience as the campers ranged in age from 8 up to over 18. Everything also had to be translated – twice – as most campers spoke either Russian or Estonian. We relied primarily on a mostly silent skit and an object lesson to make our point about being strong and courageous as we follow God’s law (<a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/joshua/passage.aspx?q=joshua%201:7-8">Joshua 1:7-8</a>). Throughout the week it was incredible to watch the way our team connected with the locals and excelled at all of their responsibilites, despite the fact that many of them had either very little camp experience or none at all.</p>
