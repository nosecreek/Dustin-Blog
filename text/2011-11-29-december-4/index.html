			<p>I’ve been meaning to post this for a while now… December 4 (this Sunday already!) is the launch date for our Sunday evening gathering. We hope that this will be a place for worship, discipleship, and fellowship which will bring Christians together to make a positive impact in the community. Prayers are appreciated!</p>
