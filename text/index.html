<p>Last night as I celebrated the beginning of a new year with friends and family we reflected on Proverbs 3:5-6:</p>

<li><h2><a href="/text/dustin-the-chef/">Dustin the Chef?</a></h2> - February 4, 2012
<p>Many of you know that I have been working for three hours a day, during the lunch rush, at the cafe in the Yellow Grass skating rink. On Monday the lady who runs the cafe (Donna) is heading out of town for four days to take a well deserved break. I offered to cover for her, so that means four days of getting up at 5AM to make coffee and cook eggs and toast for the people of Yellow Grass. Many of the people who come in to the cafe in the morning do not come for lunch, so this is an opportunity for me to connect with more people. Business at the cafe has been fairly slow during the winter months, but this last week things really started to pick up again, so I would greatly appreciate your prayers during the next few days. I do have someone coming in to help during the lunch hour, which is usually the busiest time of the day, but neither of us has the skill and experience of Donna. You could also pray that I will be able to connect with the people who come in to eat, and that I will be able to explain my purpose in coming to Yellow Grass.</p>

<li><h2><a href="/text/first-gathering-complete/">First Gathering: Complete</a></h2> - December 5, 2011
<p>We had our first fellowship gathering yesterday. Besides myself, 21 people came out. The service included singing, a short devotional, communion, a prayer time, and fellowship over coffee and rice krispie squares afterwards. Praise God that it was a success! Thank you all for your continued prayers.</p>

<li><h2><a href="/text/december-4/">December 4</a></h2> - November 28, 2011
<p>I’ve been meaning to post this for a while now… December 4 (this Sunday already!) is the launch date for our Sunday evening gathering. We hope that this will be a place for worship, discipleship, and fellowship which will bring Christians together to make a positive impact in the community. Prayers are appreciated!</p>

<li><h2><a href="/text/success/">Success!</a></h2> - October 20, 2011
<p>Our first kid’s program is complete and was a success. We had a dozen kids out, which was good because we ran into a few problems letting people know that we were starting today. Now that the word is out and the kids will be telling their friends, we are optimistic that we will have a larger group next week. Thanks to everyone who was praying today!</p>

<li><h2><a href="/text/a-vision-for-yellow-grass/">A Vision For Yellow Grass</a></h2> - August 17, 2011
<p>Two summers ago I had the privilege of visiting the town of Yellow Grass as part of Alberta Bible College’s Youth Alive in Christ program. Along with three other students and a few mission minded  volunteers from the local community, we ran a successful week-long VBS with a healthy number of children attending. This past fall I was heart broken to hear that there is currently no church presence in Yellow Grass that is actively focusing on reaching the healthy harvest of young families living there. “The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field” (Matthew 9:37-38). At the same time, God was putting similar convictions in the hearts and minds of several others and so began the journey of re-imagining the Kingdom work in Yellow Grass, Saskatchewan.</p>
