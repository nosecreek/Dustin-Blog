				<h2>Success!</h2> - October 20, 2011
			
			<p>Our first kid’s program is complete and was a success. We had a dozen kids out, which was good because we ran into a few problems letting people know that we were starting today. Now that the word is out and the kids will be telling their friends, we are optimistic that we will have a larger group next week. Thanks to everyone who was praying today!</p>
